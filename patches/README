=== Poor man's patch scheme for python libs ===

Since simply checking out the lib repo
and specifying a local path in PIP is too hard (ray build fails),
the patches here are HARD links to the real pip package file.

Hard links are created while the file is still unmodified (not patched)
and are COMMITTED (to store the file's original content).

Then the hard link-file is updated, and changes can be committed.


======= DANGER ======

If pip re-installs the original file, this hard link will no longer point
to the new file and contents will not be related.

HOW TO VERIFY? Check the top-level comment in the file (see below)

======= SUMMARY ======

1. Hard-link the file here (DO NOT PATCH YET)
2. Add a comment as the first line:

# [SIMO] hard-patch check:
# ls -i patches/ray/pbt.py patches/site-packages/ray/tune/schedulers/pbt.py

3. git commit
4. Patch the file as needed (patch it)
