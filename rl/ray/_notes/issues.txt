Issues in 2.37.0:

* MAJOR:
  PPO batches are not shuffled
  fixed in master: https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/47458
  This is critical to PPO.

* minor:
  PPO adds an extra terminal observation which means batch sizes increase
  proportionally to the number of episodes.
  E.g. 512 steps with avg. 50 terminations would result in 562 steps.
  The "terminal" observations are passed through the NN but the "critic"
  value is unused in GAE calculations, and their "actor" logits are masked
  in KL loss calculations. I checked and they have no effect on the loss calc.
  Effect on me: useless samples are fed through the NN

* trivial:
  Different distributions are used for KL loss and surrogate loss calculations.
  Left a PR here: https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/47889/files#r1814477847
  Effect on me: none (I use the same distributions)
