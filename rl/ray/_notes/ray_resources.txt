> Eval and train runners are up all the time, but are NOT used simultaneously
> Resources used (as measured on Mac M2):
  * 0.5 CPU for StupidAI
  * 1.0 CPU for BattleAI

For 2 eval + 4 train workers
> ray allocates 4 CPU
> real usage is 2 CPU

Introduce new custom resources:
* eval_cpu
* train_cpu

1 real CPU = 1 eval_cpu AND 1 train_cpu

=> For 2 eval + 4 train workers:
> ray allocates 2 eval_cpu + 2 train_cpu on a node with total 2 physical CPU
