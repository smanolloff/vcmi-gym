# RL Training

I've spent a considerable amount of time trying to design and train an AI model
in a resource-constrained setup (personal laptop) with moderate success - it
currently wins against the VCMI's Neutral AI (a.k.a. "StupidAI") and is kind of
50/50 against VCMI's "stronger" Player AI (a.k.a. "BattleAI").
It's by no means "challenging" for any decent human player, so there's much
to be desired :)

The limitations of the environment itself (e.g. having to restart the entire
game in order to switch army compositions) are negatively impacting the
training performance. Hopefully they will one day be dealt with -- the full
[list of features](https://github.com/smanolloff/vcmi) I'd like to see
implemented in VCMI shows there's still much work to be and your help would be
greatly appreciated in this regard :)
